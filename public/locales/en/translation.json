Unlike regular campaigns, the contact details and email address of the celebrity may not be known to the person creating the campaign.

They will coordinate and provide a secure login method for the celebrity to access their campaign account safely.",
        "content11": "A campaign's success depends on its position in the National Ranking, which is determined through a randomized ranking process. Each campaign is ranked based on three factors: the total amount of money raised, the number of unique supporters, and a random number between 0 and 1. These factors are combined to generate a final ranking for each campaign. To form each National Team, the top 50 men and top 50 women with the highest rankings are selected. However, teams must be balanced regarding weight categories, with each of the three weight groups equally represented. This balance requirement means that a campaign ranked 48th might not make the team if that weight category is already filled, while a campaign ranked 53rd could be included if that weight group is underrepresented.",
        "content12": "If an athlete in the top 50 cannot attend the Randolympics due to injury, personal reasons, or other circumstances, they will be replaced by the next highest-ranked athlete from their weight category. This ensures that the team remains balanced and filled. Athletes ranked just above 50 still have a chance to participate if there are dropouts or changes in the roster, providing opportunities for those with a slightly lower ranking to make it to the games.",
        "content13": "Not directly from the Randolympics organization, but each athlete is free to sign sponsorship agreements. Unlike other events, there are no restrictions on how athletes dress or what brands they can display and when. Some events might go viral, and an athlete could become famous for a specific competition, opening up more sponsorship and earning opportunities."

National coupon codes apply depending in what country athlete of campaign is located in. <br /> <br /> So, campaign for athlete who is located in Sweden, you can use only Sweden national coupon codes to make coupon-only donation to campaign. <br /> <br /> As well, using coupon code, you can have addition to payment you make. <br /> <br /> Types of coupon codes: <b>National</b> and <b>Global</b><br /> All coupon codes are 6 characters (which can be anything, doesn't determine it's value), but they have a type, which determines how much addition will be applied to donation. <br /> <br /> <b>National coupon code</b> - coupon of fixed price value. E.g. <code>SWED12</code> can be coupon name (6 chars), that will add <i>10$</i> to payment. If donation is done coupon-only then donation is done just by inserting donation code, and that's <i>10$</i> donation for that friend campaign. If on other hand, you insert this coupon code, and click <i>Next</i>, and proceed to insert credit card or Paypal amount you want to donate, then 10$ of coupon code value will be added to payment you make. So, if you make 5$ payment donation with credit card (or paypal), then together with national coupon, your donation will be calcualted as <i>15$</i> <code>(10$ + 5$ = 15$)</code> <br /> <br /> <b>Global coupon code</b> - coupon of percentage value, depending on your payment (credit card, paypal). E.g. In this case coupon code can be <code>RAND18</code>, and it's value is <i>50%</i>. So that means, <i>50%</i> is added onto payment you make via credit card (paypal). So, if you make <i>5$</i> payment donation via credit card or paypal, then your actual donation will be calculated as <i>7.5$</i> <code>(5$ + 50% = 7.5$)</code><code>(50% of 5$ )</code>"

The standard dimensions are approximately 100-110 meters long and 64-75 meters wide.</span></li> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Duration</b><span >: A standard match consists of two halves, each lasting 45 minutes, with a 15-minute halftime break.

Fouls can result in direct or indirect free kicks, depending on the nature of the infraction.</span></li> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Yellow and Red Cards</b><span >: Referees issue yellow cards as warnings for misconduct. Two yellow cards result in a red card, which sends the player off the field. A straight red card may also be given for severe fouls, and the team plays with one less player.</span></li> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Throw-ins, Goal Kicks, and Corner Kicks</b><span >: When the ball goes out of play, it is restarted via throw-ins (when the ball goes out over the sidelines), goal kicks (when the attacking team touches it last before it goes out over the goal line), or corner kicks (when the defending team touches it last).</span></li> </ul> <br/> <p class=\"text-lg md:text-xl\"><b>Positions:</b></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Goalkeeper</b><span >: The only player allowed to use their hands within the penalty area. Their primary role is to prevent goals.</span></li> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Defenders</b><span >: Players who primarily focus on stopping opposing attackers and protecting the goal. They include center-backs and full-backs.</span></li> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Midfielders</b><span >: Players who link defense and attack. They often control the ball and create goal-scoring opportunities.</span></li> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Forwards</b><span >: Players primarily responsible for scoring goals. They are often the most attacking players on the team.</span></li> </ul> <br/> <p class=\"text-lg md:text-xl\"><b>Competitions:</b></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-size: 16px;\" ><b>Domestic Leagues</b><span >: Most countries have a league system where teams compete for the championship.
