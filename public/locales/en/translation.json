        "content2": "Anyone can start a campaign! All you need is a friend who believes in you and at least one dollar to get started. It's a simple way to motivate someone to achieve extraordinary goals",
        "content3": "Anyone can participate as an athlete! The only requirements are that you have a valid passport and are at least 12 years old. There’s no upper age limit, so no one is too old or too young to join!",
        "content4": "To gather more supporters, share your campaign on social media, send personalized messages to your network on WhatsApp, and spread the word in your gym, sports club, or community. The more people know, the more they can support!",

        "content5": "This small minimum amount is a safeguard against fake or automated accounts. It helps ensure that each supporter is a real, unique person genuinely interested in backing an athlete.",

        "content7": "Yes, you can create as many campaigns as you want! Starting a campaign is a huge compliment to a friend—a sign that you believe in their potential to achieve extraordinary things. Campaigns also make a thoughtful and inspiring gift for special occasions, like birthdays.",

        "content8": "Yes, you can! You can participate as an athlete in a campaign set up by your friend while also creating multiple campaigns yourself to support others. Your involvement can be as broad and supportive as you want it to be.",

        "content9": "If the campaign is successful, the raised money will be transferred to the athlete to support their journey to the Randolympics, including training, equipment, and other preparation expenses. Additionally, if supporters wish to attend the event, up to three supporters from the campaign will receive a contribution towards their flight tickets to help them be part of the experience. If the campaign does not succeed in getting the athlete into an event, the donations will be used to ensure the event runs smoothly and is well-funded.",

        "content10": "A celebrity campaign is similar to a normal campaign, but with a few key differences. Unlike regular campaigns, the contact details and email address of the celebrity may not be known to the person creating the campaign. If the celebrity decides to consider attending the Randolympics and wants to log in to their account, they need to announce their interest on social media and then contact both the National President and the campaign creator. They will coordinate and provide a secure login method for the celebrity to access their campaign account safely.",
        "content11": "A campaign's success depends on its position in the National Ranking, which is determined through a randomized ranking process. Each campaign is ranked based on three factors: the total amount of money raised, the number of unique supporters, and a random number between 0 and 1. These factors are combined to generate a final ranking for each campaign. To form each National Team, the top 50 men and top 50 women with the highest rankings are selected. However, teams must be balanced regarding weight categories, with each of the three weight groups equally represented. This balance requirement means that a campaign ranked 48th might not make the team if that weight category is already filled, while a campaign ranked 53rd could be included if that weight group is underrepresented.",
        "content12": "If an athlete in the top 50 cannot attend the Randolympics due to injury, personal reasons, or other circumstances, they will be replaced by the next highest-ranked athlete from their weight category. This ensures that the team remains balanced and filled. Athletes ranked just above 50 still have a chance to participate if there are dropouts or changes in the roster, providing opportunities for those with a slightly lower ranking to make it to the games.",
        "content13": "Not directly from the Randolympics organization, but each athlete is free to sign sponsorship agreements. Unlike other events, there are no restrictions on how athletes dress or what brands they can display and when. Some events might go viral, and an athlete could become famous for a specific competition, opening up more sponsorship and earning opportunities."

However, in extreme situations—such as a delay in the first competition and a traffic jam between venues—it is theoretically possible that an athlete may not be able to compete in the second event.
